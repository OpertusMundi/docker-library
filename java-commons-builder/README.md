# README - java-commons-builder

A builder image that basically prepares a Maven repository. This will speed-up builds for [java-commons](https://github.com/OpertusMundi/java-commons).

The `pom.xml` is based on the actual upstream [POM](https://github.com/OpertusMundi/java-commons/blob/master/pom.xml).
